              <strong>What makes Optonaut different from other panorama/photosphere Apps?</strong><br/>
              Optonaut records a scene in a stereographic way. That means you can view it in 3D, as if you were there.
              You can not only look around, but also perceive depth and dimension.

              <strong>Does Optonaut work with my smartphone?</strong><br/>

              <strong>What data is transmitted to your servers when stitching? </strong><br/>
              The images including orientation data of your phone.
              At the moment we need to transmit those data since the 3D conversion process is very battery consuming.
              If we find a way around that weâ€™ll let you know.
